ðŸŽ‰ **Beta Test Release** ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the first beta of ScrollBlocker! This build includes:

- **Instagram Reels blocker**: Fullâ€‘screen overlay whenever you enter Reels.  
- **TikTok blocker**: Overlay active whenever TikTok is in the foreground.  
- **YouTube Shorts blocker**: Covers Shorts in official YouTube.
- **Instant block/unblock**: Zero delay on entry and exit (Back gesture, home tab, app switch).  
- **Touchâ€‘through overlay**: Allows pullâ€‘down notifications and system gestures while visually blocking the feed.

**How to test**  
1. Download the APK asset below and install on your device.
2. Go to **Settings -> Apps -> ScrollBlocker** and in the top right corner allow restricted permissions.
3. Enable **ScrollBlockService** under **Settings â†’ Accessibility**.  
4. Open each supported feed (Reels, TikTok, Shorts) and verify the white overlay appears and disappears as expected.  
5. Report any issues or edge cases (e.g. specific device OEM quirks) via the GitHub Issues page.

Thank you for helping me test out the beta!
